# Code Complete

I was trying to develop a script using Python and a framework called web3.py. The goal was to sign a message using the Ethereum EIP... so that the message could be verified before committing to the Ethereum chain. A concept, along with what an EIP is, will be discussed in other chapters of this book. However, in the documentation the code snippet didn't work because of a missing Python import.

This might be obvious to regular Python users, but I found this a bit frustrating. I believe that code samples should run within reason, by cutting and pasting, and not having developers have to Google missing imports. This is what package managers like PIP or yarn, framework version managers like NVM, and technologies like Docker solve.

It's my goal in this book to have code snippets runnable, or at least links to GitHub repositories with all the instructions required to run the code. This is of course a challenge with different operating systems, chips, and new frameworks and versions. But like I said, it is a goal.
