# Prerequisites

I will deliberately jump around different languages and tech stacks, just like a 7 course degustation menu, each course has its own flavour. If you're familiar with these languages and how to get up and running on your local environment, feel free to skip along. Otherwise, I will document my approach to get up and running to save you the hassle of reading others' documentation or blog posts.

These may not be the "production way", but this book is about getting up and running, completing something, and coming back later once you have competency in the core concepts.
