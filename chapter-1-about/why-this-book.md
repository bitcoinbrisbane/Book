# Why this book?

Im not sure about you, but when I have the opportunity to build a new application or project from scratch, I feel a mixture of excitement and fear.  So many choices but also the opportunity to explore new technologies, languages and frameworks.  All too often however, those choices are constrained by real world factors such as time and money.

Building a distributed application is hard.  There are many parts of the application that are hard, from the networking layer to the consensus algorithm to the UI.  All these layers not only have the challenges associated with them, but also the challenges of the language choices too.

In 2022 there are so many great languages to choose from, so which ones should we choose?  For my own personal projects I'm often torn between new and cool tech or tried and tested languages that I know backwards so I know the project might actually get done without the frustration of having to learn a new language.  That said, learning is fun and its a good way to stay current and explore new tech.

In this book Iâ€™ll present the technologies that are popular and up and coming paired with some exciting new languages and frameworks that should get even the seasoned developer excited.
