# The Idea of this project

The idea is to build a domain specific blockchain!  But first of all two qhestions.  What is a domain specific blockchaina and do we really need one?  There have been numerous papers whch will review in chapter 4.

The idea of "poker over the phone" where by parties can plan on insecure channels, and with truestless parties has been described in the paper "Mental Poker".

For our project become a thing, we must also include a few other components which make it perfect for a blockchian application.  Poker is fundametly about money.  Remove the financial incenctives of poker and it gets boring really quickly.  Stablecoins have become the backbone for adoption, with USDC and USDT market share.

(Genius bill?)
