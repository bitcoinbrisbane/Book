Blockchains are collections of connected nodes that listen for state changes and then replicate the data to all other nodes. This is similar to how a replicated database works, but with a few differences. Blockchains have been referred to as a good way to transfer value. I don't think this is entirely correct. Blockchains are a way for machines to change the state of the system, while allowing users to manage the state via transactions signed by their private keys.

State of course can represent a number, which in turn can represent value. State variables can be of typical programming language types, such as booleans, numbers and strings, or complex types, data structures and objects that represent or model ideas or real world objects.

In 2026 there are some db designs such as...

So why poker? Poker is a turn based game, where each player agrees, or should agree, on the rules of the game. Then, let's say outside of a casino for example, each player witnesses the game and agrees that that turn or action was within the agreed rules of the game.

Each legal turn updates the state of the game. With poker, the state is managed by the deck of cards, the dealt hole cards, the players' chips and the chips in the pot. In our application these will be represented by updating the state of the chain.

Like most card games, there are also home and location variances of the game. These rules can be agreed upon by the players before the game. This is an example of a consensus mechanism. In this book we will code an example of this.
